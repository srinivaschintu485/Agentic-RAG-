# Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) - Hugging Face Implementation

üìù Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using the Hugging Face transformers, langchain, and sentence-transformers libraries. It showcases how to leverage retrieval-based knowledge augmentation for more accurate and context-aware responses from large language models (LLMs). The notebook integrates various components to achieve an efficient, scalable RAG pipeline that can answer queries by retrieving relevant documents and generating responses in a human-like conversational manner.

# ü§ñ Model Used

The project uses models from Hugging Face, including:

Meta LLaMA-3: A large language model capable of text generation, conversational responses, and contextual understanding.

Sentence Transformers: Used for document embeddings and semantic search to retrieve the most relevant pieces of information from a knowledge base.

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): An efficient similarity search tool used to perform fast vector searches on large datasets.

The notebook combines these components to build a robust retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system.

# üìö What is Agentic RAG?

Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a modern approach to improving the accuracy and context-awareness of language models by integrating an external knowledge retrieval step before generating a response.

# How Agentic RAG Works:

Query Processing: The user inputs a query.

Document Retrieval: The system retrieves relevant documents from a pre-built knowledge base using semantic search.

Knowledge-Augmented Generation: The retrieved documents are fed into a language model to generate an accurate, context-aware response.

# üöÄ Why Agentic RAG Came to Picture

Traditional language models generate responses based solely on their pre-trained knowledge, which can become outdated or limited. Agentic RAG addresses this limitation by dynamically retrieving the most relevant, up-to-date information from a knowledge base, ensuring:

Up-to-Date Knowledge: Always provides current and accurate information.

Context-Aware Responses: Generates responses based on the context provided by the retrieved documents.

Scalability: Can be applied to large-scale knowledge bases with minimal performance trade-offs.

# üîç How Agentic RAG Overcomes Traditional Disadvantages

Traditional language models face the following challenges:

Challenge

Traditional LLMs

Agentic RAG

Outdated Knowledge

Relies on pre-training

Retrieves real-time data

Lack of Contextual Depth

Limited context window

Augments with relevant docs

Scalability Issues

Struggles with large KBs

Efficient vector search

Agentic RAG combines LLMs with external knowledge retrieval to overcome these limitations.

Here are some example queries and the system's responses:



üìà Advantages of Using Agentic RAG

Accuracy: Provides more accurate answers by using real-time retrieval.

Context Awareness: Generates responses based on the latest and most relevant information.

Scalability: Works efficiently with large knowledge bases using FAISS.
